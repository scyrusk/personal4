		<h1>How can we design better user-facing cybersecurity systems?</h1>
		<div class="lead">Sauvik Das</div>

		<h2>Understand your starting point (2 mins)</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Mobile authentication:</strong> How can we make mobile authentication more social?</li>
			<li><strong>Updating software:</strong> How can we convince users to keep their software updated?</li>
			<li><strong>Two-factor authentication:</strong> How can we make the benefits of two-factor authentication understandable?</li>
			<li><strong>Software installation:</strong> How can we make users value security in deciding which software to install?</li>
			<li><strong>Phishing:</strong> How can we make suspicious links and webpages more visible?</li>
			<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> How can we make encrypting e-mail easier?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Feel free to narrow down the problem as much as you'd like. These are just starting points.</p>

		<h2>Discuss opportunities with your group (~10 min)</h2>

		<p>What approaches can help solve your problem? Does it have to be a technology driven approach?</p>

		<p>Who are the relevant stakeholders? End-users may not be the only actors with a vested interest in their security.</p>

		<p>What are the shortcomings or challenges in implementing different approaches?</p>

		<p>Remember that usability should ideally not compromise security. But, ask yourself if the assumptions of how much security is needed is appropriate in all contexts.</p>

		<p><em>I might ask a representative of your group to share your thoughts with the class.</em></p>
