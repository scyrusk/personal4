        A few of my papers have been recognized with awards:
        a best paper at UbiComp (2013) and CHI (2024),
        a distinguished paper at SOUPS (2020) and USENIX Security (2024),
        four best paper honorable mentions at CHI (2016, 2017, 2020, 2024),
        a best paper honorable mention at CSCW (2021),
        and an honorable mention for the NSA's Best Scientific Cybersecurity Paper (2014).

        Prospective Ph.D. Students
      %p
        I am always on the lookout for talented Ph.D. students.
        If you are interested in working with me, I encourage you to apply to the
        = link_to "HCII Ph.D.", "https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/phd-hci"
        at Carnegie Mellon and mention my name in your application.
        I'm afraid that I am unlikely to respond to cold e-mails; I just have too many
        other things to do in my limited workday.
        A few years ago, I made a
